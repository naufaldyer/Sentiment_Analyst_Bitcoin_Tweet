# Sentiment_Analyst_Bitcoin_Tweet-s

In this project, I am trying to process NLP data about bitcoin tweets. I got this data from kaggle.com. Here I will try to predict Sentiment from tweets about bitcoin.

There are so many languages that are used to tweet about bitcoin, so I will use a language detector to detect the language used and only choose English.

Text vectorization will also be carried out here, because the data I process is sentence data, not numbers, while the computer can only read numbers.

The model I use is Long Short Term Memories (LSTM), basically LSTM is one of the layers contained in the Neurol Network. There will be several trials using LSTM to find the best model.
